# Tasks

Tasks is a lossless, exhaustive compiler for turning authoritative goals, specifications, plans, exports, and other source material into small, self-contained work items. It preserves source coverage, provenance, constraints, and dependencies so implementation agents can pick up narrowly scoped work without reconstructing the original planning context.

Tasks currently uses Beads as its native task backend. It supports OpenAI Codex and Claude Code.

Tasks independently reviews both proposed and durable task graphs. Correctable review defects are repaired against the current design rather than abandoning the transaction, and substantive transactions keep resumable recovery checkpoints until final review passes.

## Install
